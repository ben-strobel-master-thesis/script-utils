# Script Utils

This repository contains scripts for using the Emercast simulator to run batch simulations with a variety of parameters.
To do this, the scripts also use the [ONE simulator](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one) to create a movement plan for the Emercast simulator.
It also contains script to parse and analyze the metrics and logs create by the Emercast simulator.
These script are used to create graphs after the batch simulation.
The results of this script are the main content of the Evaluation chapter of the thesis.
